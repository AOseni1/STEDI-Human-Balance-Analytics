# STEDI Human Balance Analytics

Project 3 of Udacity's Data Engineering with AWS Nanodegree Program

Project Overview:
Contributed to the development of a data lakehouse solution to process and curate sensor data for training a machine learning model to detect steps in real-time. This involved extracting data from various sources, including STEDI Step Trainer sensors and a mobile application, and preparing it for use by data scientists to build a machine learning model. Utilized AWS Glue, Apache Spark, and other cloud-based technologies to create a scalable and secure data pipeline.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Integration & ETL: Designed and implemented AWS Glue jobs to process and transform sensor data from STEDI Step Trainer devices and the accompanying mobile app. This involved categorizing and cleaning raw data for future querying and analysis.

Data Lakehouse Design: Developed and managed a data lakehouse architecture on AWS to store curated, high-quality sensor data. The data was made available for machine learning training, ensuring it met privacy and security standards.

Data Curation for ML Training: Curated and organized training datasets for a machine learning model that detects steps based on motion sensor readings, ensuring that only data from consenting early adopters was included to maintain privacy compliance.

Privacy & Compliance: Ensured that all data handling adhered to privacy protocols, using only data from customers who had explicitly agreed to share their sensor data for research purposes.

Technologies Used: AWS Glue, Apache Spark, AWS S3, AWS Athena, Python
