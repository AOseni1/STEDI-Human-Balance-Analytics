*STEDI Human Balance Analytics (Data Lakehouse)*

Project Overview:
Contributed to building a data lakehouse to process sensor data for a machine learning model that detects steps in real-time. Designed ETL pipelines using AWS Glue to clean, integrate, and curate accelerometer and customer data for downstream ML training.

Key Features:

Sanitization and integration of customer and sensor data.

Creation of curated datasets for ML training.

Compliance with privacy and security standards.

Technologies: Python, AWS Glue, Athena, S3, Spark, Data Lakehouse

Project Goals: Deliver a reliable, privacy-compliant dataset to enable accurate ML models for real-time step detection.
